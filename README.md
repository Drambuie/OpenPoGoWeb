# OpenPoGoBotWeb2
Web View for OpenPoGoBot and PokemonGo-Bot

**Note**: This is a fork of [OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoWeb](https://github.com/OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoWeb/) (wchill/refactor branch). This repo contains my personal modification and optimizations.

## Installation and Use
This project is a module of OpenPogoBot and PokemonGo-Bot (please refer to OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoWeb for the most recent Installation guide).

To use this repo, it should be as simple as overwriting the old files from OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoWeb and updating your config.js file (check the config.js.example file for, yeah well.. example).
